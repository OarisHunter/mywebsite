    During my time at Penn State I've learned some of my most vital skills that have I have taken through my college career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learned a lot about a healthy work life balance.

    I spent a lot of my free time as an annual member of the *Penn State Hack-a-Thon*, and as a member of Penn State's Chapter of *Association for Computing Machinery*.
